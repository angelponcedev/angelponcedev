# Nice to meet you! :star:
Currently I'm a CS undergrad stuying at Universidad Autonoma de Aguascalientes :blue_book:, and i'm pretty much invested in developing my programming skills, hence, i spend quite a bit of time on making computers render good looking stuff :blush:.
## What you'll find here :mag_right:
I use this profile to document and keep track of all the code written under my cs major and all the related code adventures that i have on a regular basis. in other words here are the main things that i've been looking up to:

- *Javascript / TS*
- *CSS/HTML*
- *Python*
- *C/C++*
